assembly.text=The assembly table is an essential part for your turret cravings, as it crafts any item and turret you need or want.\n\nTo operate it you need power as well as the items required for the item you want to craft. It currently accepts Redstone Flux, Tesla, Forge Energy and derivatives as energy types.\n\nIf you think it's too slow or you want to automate it, there are a couple of upgrades available.
generator.text=This machine creates energy from items (mostly food) with high enough acid or base by reacting with the electrolyte within them.\nThe more items are put in it, the higher the efficiency of the generator.\n\nEach item has its own effectiveness and decay time, which dictate how much power can be generated in total. The effectiveness level also influences the amount of power the generator can produce in a moment, but there is only so much the generator can transfer internally, so there is a cap of 200 RF/t.\n\nItems used up in the generator may produce byproducts, which could be §2trash§0 or rarely something §dvaluable§0.
tcu.text=This item is a configuration and info tool for placed turrets.\n\nLooking at a turret with this tool in hand shows an info label on it with information about its name, health and ammo.\n\nRight-Clicking a turret with it will open a GUI that lets you see detailed info and configure it, like targets and upgrades.
